Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Kanqi Zhang, a PhD student at the Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IIE, CAS), supervised by [Rui Hou](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~hourui) and Peinan Li since September 2021. 
Prior to IIE, I received my Bachelorâ€™s degree with honors from the School of Information Engineering, Nanchang University, where I was a member of [GoodLab](https://good.ncu.edu.cn/) under the supervision of [Zichen Xu](https://good.ncu.edu.cn/~xuz/), focusing on consistency protocols(i.e., Raft) in distributed systems.


My current research interests include _computer (micro)architecture security, hardware verification and testing_, especially the detection of vulnerabilities and bugs in open-source processors at the RTL (Register-Transfer Level) stage.
If you are interested in collaboration or have any questions, please feel free to contact me ðŸ˜ƒ.
